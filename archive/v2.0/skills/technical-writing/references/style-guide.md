## Voice Characteristics

### Conversational Authority

Write with confidence while remaining accessible. You know what you're talking about—share that knowledge without being preachy or condescending.

### Challenge Assumptions

Don't just accept common wisdom. If you disagree with conventional approaches, say so. Explain why. Your readers want your perspective, not a recap of what everyone else thinks.

### Ground Abstract Ideas

Start with concrete personal observations before expanding to broader lessons. "I noticed X in my code" → "This reflects a larger pattern."

---

## Structure

### Openings

Start with:
- An unexpected angle
- A compelling question
- A specific observation
- The actual point

Skip the preamble. Don't warm up—start hot.

### Paragraphs

Keep them short: 1-4 sentences maximum.

Use white space as a compositional element. Let ideas breathe.

### Closings

End with declarative, memorable statements. Don't hedge. Don't summarize everything you just said.

A good ending feels like a period, not an ellipsis.

---

## Sentences

### Rhythm

Alternate between:
- Short punchy statements.
- Longer constructions that develop ideas with nuance and give readers time to process.

Monotonous rhythm puts readers to sleep.

### Voice and Tense

- Favor active voice
- Use present tense, even when reflecting on past work
- "I built this" not "This was built"
- "The function handles X" not "X is handled by the function"

### Emphasis

Use italics for:
- Emphasis on specific words
- Internal commentary
- When you're almost talking to yourself

Use bold for:
- Key phrases in instructional content
- Terms being defined

---

## Content

### Show Your Process

Build toward insights by showing your work. Let readers discover conclusions alongside you. Don't just state the answer—show how you got there.

### Use Questions

Questions invite reader participation. They create space for the reader to think.

What did I miss? What would you do differently?

### Specifics First

Present concrete examples before abstracting principles. The specific is more memorable than the general.

### Make Bold Claims

Take positions. Put personal investment on display. "I think X is wrong" is more interesting than "Some might argue X has drawbacks."

---

## Formatting

### Headers

Minimize headers in shorter pieces. They can fragment your argument.

In longer pieces, headers help readers navigate—but don't let them substitute for actual transitions.

### Links

Integrate hyperlinks naturally. Don't disrupt flow with "[click here]" or excessive inline URLs.

### Quotes

Use blockquotes for external voices. Set them apart visually.

> Someone else's words get this treatment.

## What to Cut

Remove:
- Jargon that doesn't add precision
- Excessive qualification ("In my opinion, I think maybe...")
- Lengthy preambles before the point
- Redundant explanations (link instead)
- Corporate language
- Warming up to your main point

If you can cut a word without changing meaning, cut it.

## Summary

The best technical writing is:

- **Direct**: Get to the point
- **Rhythmic**: Vary sentence and paragraph length
- **Personal**: Your voice, your perspective
- **Grounded**: Specific examples, concrete observations
- **Curious**: Show genuine interest in the problem

Write like you're explaining to a smart friend who cares about the details.
