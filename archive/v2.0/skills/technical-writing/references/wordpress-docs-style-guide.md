This reference summarizes the official WordPress Documentation Style Guide. Apply these standards to all WordPress-related documentation and marketing content.

## Core Principles

### Voice and Tone

Write in a **conversational tone that is succinct, natural, and friendly**. Balance informal and professional language while prioritizing clarity for global, non-native English speakers.

### Golden Rules

1. Use **second person** ("you") to address readers
2. Use **present tense** for current functionality
3. Use **active voice** over passive
4. Keep sentences **brief and focused**
5. Use **contractions** for natural flow

---

## Language Standards

### Word Choice

- Use **American English** spelling (analyze, not analyse)
- Choose **common, simple terms** over technical jargon
- Define unfamiliar terms on first use
- Maintain consistent terminology throughout

### Avoid These Patterns

| Don't Use | Use Instead |
|-----------|-------------|
| blacklist/whitelist | blocklist/allowlist |
| master | main |
| webmaster | site admin |
| manpower | workforce |
| chairman | chairperson |
| click here | descriptive link text |

### Abbreviations

- Spell out on first use: "Search Engine Optimization (SEO)"
- After first use, abbreviation alone is fine
- Common abbreviations (HTML, CSS, API) don't need spelling out

---

## Formatting

### Headings

- Use **sentence case** (Capitalize first word only)
- Follow proper hierarchy: H1 → H2 → H3 (no skipping)
- H1 for page title only
- Keep headings concise and descriptive

### Lists

- Use **numbered lists** for sequential steps
- Use **bullet lists** for unordered items
- Keep list items parallel in structure
- End list items consistently (all periods or none)

### Dates and Times

- Date format: **Monday, January 15, 2025**
- Time format: **2:00 PM** (12-hour with AM/PM)
- Use timezone when relevant: **2:00 PM EST**

### Code and UI Elements

- Use `monospace` for code, file names, commands
- Use **bold** for UI elements: **Settings > General**
- Use *italics* for emphasis and new terms
- Placeholders: `<PLACEHOLDER_NAME>` in uppercase

---

## Accessibility

### Text

- Use clear, simple sentences
- Provide alt text for images (under 50 characters)
- Define abbreviations and acronyms
- Maintain heading hierarchy

### Media

- Provide transcripts for audio/video
- Include closed captions
- Don't rely on color alone to convey meaning
- Maintain 4.5:1 minimum contrast ratio

### Navigation

- Avoid direction-based instructions alone ("click the button on the right")
- Consider keyboard-only navigation
- Test with screen readers

---

## Inclusivity

### Gender-Neutral Language

- Use "they/their/them" for singular individuals
- Restructure sentences to use "you" when possible
- Avoid gendered terms: use "workforce" not "manpower"

### Disability Terminology

- Use "person with disability" not "the disabled"
- Use specific terms: "deaf," "blind," "low-vision"
- Avoid "-impaired" or "-challenged" suffixes
- Never use ableist slurs or "suffering from" language

### Diverse Examples

- Include varied names, ages, locations in examples
- Represent different backgrounds authentically
- Avoid stereotypes and assumptions

---

## What to Avoid

### Never Use

- Colloquialisms and idioms
- Unnecessary humor or cultural references
- Excessive politeness ("Please kindly...")
- Exclamation points (sparingly, if at all)
- Condescending commands
- Long, complex sentences
- Assumptions about reader knowledge

### Don't Start With

- "Simply..."
- "Just..."
- "Obviously..."
- "As you know..."
- "It's easy to..."

These imply the reader should already understand, which can be discouraging.
