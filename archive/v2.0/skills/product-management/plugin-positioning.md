**who** [specific unmet need or frustration]
**[Product Name]** is a [product category]
**that** [key benefit/value proposition].

```

## Differentiation Strategies

```
Focuses on what users actually care about.

- "Accessible to WCAG 2.1 AA"

**Business Model**

- "Lifetime updates, one price"
- "Open source, no lock-in"

**Trust**
- "By WordPress core contributors"
- "10 years in the repository"
- "Used by [notable sites]"

## Example Positioning Statements

### Security Plugin
```markdown
**For** WordPress site owners
**who** worry about security but don't understand technical details,
**SecureWP** is a security plugin
**that** protects your site automatically without configuration.
**Unlike** Wordfence which requires security expertise to configure correctly,
**our product** provides enterprise-grade protection that works out of the box.
```

### Performance Plugin
```markdown
**For** WordPress developers
**who** need to deliver fast sites to clients,
**SpeedKit** is a performance optimization toolkit
**that** achieves 90+ PageSpeed scores with one click.
**Unlike** manual optimization that takes hours per site,
**our product** automates the entire process and documents what it changed.
```

### Block Plugin
```markdown
**For** content creators using Gutenberg
**who** need design flexibility without a page builder,
**BlockPro** is a block collection
**that** extends the editor with 50+ production-ready patterns.
**Unlike** heavy page builders that slow sites and create lock-in,
**our blocks** use native WordPress patterns that work with any theme.
```

## Validation Questions

Test your positioning by asking:

1. **Clarity**: Can a user understand this in 10 seconds?
2. **Differentiation**: Is it clear why you're different?
3. **Credibility**: Can you prove the claims?
4. **Relevance**: Does the target segment care about this?
5. **Sustainability**: Can competitors easily copy this?

## Competitive Landscape Research

Before positioning, research:
- WordPress.org repository alternatives (free)
- Premium marketplace alternatives (CodeCanyon, etc.)
- SaaS alternatives (non-WordPress solutions)
- DIY/manual alternatives (what they do without a plugin)

Document:
- Active installations
- Rating and review sentiment
- Pricing model
- Key features
- Common complaints

<best_practices>
