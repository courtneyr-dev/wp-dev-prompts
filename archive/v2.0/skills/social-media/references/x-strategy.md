# X Content Strategy

> **Source**: [richtabor/agent-skills](https://github.com/richtabor/agent-skills/tree/main/skills/x-writing/references)

## Core Formula

**Volume + Value = Growth**

Success comes from posting 3+ times daily with authentic insights, not recycled advice.

## Goal

Build an audience that respects your ideas, not just follower count.

## Three Essential Pillars

Every effective post requires all three:

### 1. Genuine Value

Fresh insights from real experience that:
- Surprise the reader
- Contradict common assumptions
- Help others avoid mistakes you made
- Share non-obvious discoveries

**Not valuable**: Generic advice anyone could give.

### 2. Immediate Actionability

Practical systems people can implement today:
- Specific steps, not vague suggestions
- Tools with concrete benefits
- Workflows they can copy

**Not actionable**: Observations without takeaways.

### 3. Natural Engagement

Content structured to organically trigger:
- Bookmarks (save for later)
- Replies (conversation starters)
- Questions that invite participation
- Teasers that promise more

**Not engaging**: Posts that don't invite response.

## Content Types

### Always Share

- Shipped work with learnings
- Non-obvious insights from experience
- Tool recommendations with specific benefits
- Solutions to problems others face
- Counter-intuitive patterns you've discovered

### Consider Sharing

- Industry takes with a unique angle
- Process improvements backed by examples
- Questions you're genuinely curious about

### Skip

- Vague progress updates ("making progress!")
- Generic motivation
- Complaints without solutions
- Engagement bait without substance
- Recycled advice without personal experience

## High-Performing Patterns

### 1. Shipped X, Learned Y
Document what you built and the unexpected lessons.

### 2. Here's What I Learned
Number-driven lists from real experience.

### 3. How to Do X
Step-by-step from someone who's done it.

### 4. Problem → Solution
Relatable problem with specific fix.

### 5. Specific vs Generic
Show the difference between vague and concrete.

### 6. Tool Recommendation
Specific tool + specific benefit + measurable result.

## Weekly Content Mix

Target 21+ posts per week:

| Category | Percentage | Posts/Week |
|----------|------------|------------|
| Educational/How-to | 38% | 8 |
| Personal updates | 29% | 6 |
| Insights/Observations | 19% | 4 |
| Questions/Engagement | 14% | 3 |

## Quality Benchmark

Before posting, ask:

> "Would I bookmark this if someone else wrote it?"

This single test ensures you're serving your audience.

## What Makes Posts Save-Worthy

- Reference material (steps, lists, resources)
- Unique insight not found elsewhere
- Actionable framework
- Specific numbers or results
- Counter-intuitive truth

## Engagement Triggers

**Bookmarks**: Lists, steps, resources, frameworks
**Replies**: Questions, hot takes, relatable problems
**Retweets**: Unique insights, helpful threads, quotable lines
