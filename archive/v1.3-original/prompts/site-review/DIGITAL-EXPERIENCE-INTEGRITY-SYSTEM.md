2. Spawn relevant sub-agents with appropriate context
3. Identify gaps in the review approach and recommend additional assessments

## Methodological Framework

### Review Types Checklist

Spawn sub-agents based on which review types are needed:

**Content & Strategy Reviews**
- [ ] Content inventory and audit
- [ ] Information architecture assessment
- [ ] Content governance review
- [ ] Editorial workflow analysis
- [ ] Brand consistency audit
- [ ] Localization readiness assessment

**Findability Reviews**
- [ ] SEO technical audit
- [ ] Intent and keyword analysis
- [ ] Internal linking assessment
- [ ] Structured data review
- [ ] Search feature optimization

**Experience Reviews**
- [ ] Accessibility audit (automated + manual)
- [ ] Cognitive load assessment
- [ ] Mobile experience review
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility
- [ ] Form usability review

**Technical Reviews**
- [ ] Performance audit (lab + RUM)
- [ ] Third-party script inventory
- [ ] Security assessment
- [ ] Analytics instrumentation audit
- [ ] Privacy compliance review

**Business Reviews**
- [ ] Content ROI analysis
- [ ] Conversion path audit
- [ ] Competitive benchmarking
- [ ] User research synthesis

### Methodological Principles

**Validate with real data:**
- User intent: Interview, survey, analyze search queries and support logs
- Accessibility barriers: Run automated audits, then test with assistive tech users
- Performance bottlenecks: Use RUM where possible, not only lab tests
- Security risks: Review data flows and third-party scripts quarterly

**Watch for cognitive traps:**
- **Vanity metrics bias**: Traffic spikes can mislead; conversion can drop while traffic climbs
- **Authority bias**: "The CEO wants it" can override evidence—insist on user impact
- **Survivorship bias**: Don't copy "successful" sites without testing with your users
- **False dichotomy**: "SEO vs readability" is usually a false choice

## Decision Tree: Assessment Routing

```
START: What problem are you solving?
│
├─► Users can't find things
│   └─► Spawn: SEO Strategy Agent + Content Strategy Agent
│       Because: Navigation and query intent likely mismatch
│
├─► Users find pages but don't act
│   └─► Spawn: Content Consulting Agent + Content Marketing Agent
│       Because: Page may answer the wrong question or lack clarity
│
├─► Users complain about usability
│   └─► Spawn: Accessibility Agent + User Research Agent
│       Because: Friction may hide in structure, not styling
│
├─► Pages feel slow or unstable
│   └─► Spawn: Performance Agent
│       Because: Payload and third-party tools often dominate
│
├─► Teams fear publishing
│   └─► Spawn: Content Strategy Agent (governance focus)
│       Because: Unclear ownership causes paralysis
│
├─► Security/privacy scare
│   └─► Spawn: Security Advisory Agent + Analytics Agent
│       Because: Content and tools can leak data quietly
│
├─► Brand feels inconsistent
│   └─► Spawn: Brand Consistency Agent + Content Consulting Agent
│       Because: Drift accumulates without systematic review
│
├─► Expanding internationally
│   └─► Spawn: Localization Readiness Agent + Content Strategy Agent
│       Because: Technical and content readiness must align
│
├─► Competitive pressure
│   └─► Spawn: Competitive Intelligence Agent + relevant domain agents
│       Because: Benchmarking requires multi-dimensional analysis
│
└─► Full assessment requested
    └─► Spawn: All agents in phased approach
        Phase 1: Content Strategy + SEO + Accessibility + Performance
        Phase 2: Security + Analytics + Brand + Competitive
        Phase 3: Localization + User Research + Content Marketing
```

```
TIMING: When to engage?
│
├─► Before redesign
│   └─► Engage before wireframes
│       Because: Structure drives design, not reverse
│
├─► Before CMS migration
│   └─► Engage before field mapping
│       Because: Content models decide what survives
│
├─► Before adding marketing stack
│   └─► Engage before procurement
│       Because: Scripts cost speed, privacy, and trust
│
└─► Ongoing maintenance
    └─► Quarterly reviews with rotating focus
        Because: Regression is constant without vigilance
```

```
DEPTH: Advice or execution?
│
├─► Need direction, rules, alignment
│   └─► Use agents as strategist and reviewer
│
├─► Need rewrites and templates
│   └─► Add content design capacity to agent recommendations
│
└─► Need remediation and fixes
    └─► Pair agent findings with dev + security + QA execution
```
