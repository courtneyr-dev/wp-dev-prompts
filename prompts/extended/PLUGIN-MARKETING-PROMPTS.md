6. **Stay Authentic**: Edit AI content to sound human and genuine
7. **Fact-Check**: Verify all claims and statistics
8. **SEO Balance**: Optimize for search but write for humans first

### Prompt Enhancement Tips:

Add these to any prompt for better results:
- "Use a conversational, approachable tone"
- "Include specific examples and scenarios"
- "Avoid jargon; explain technical terms simply"
- "Make it scannable with bullets and short paragraphs"
