FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

New WordPress Plugin Simplifies Form Building for Non-Technical Users
FormEase Launches with Drag-and-Drop Interface, Eliminating Need for Coding

SAN FRANCISCO, CA – December 11, 2025 –

Acme Digital Solutions today announced the launch of FormEase, a WordPress plugin that enables website owners to create professional contact forms without any coding knowledge. FormEase is now available for free download on WordPress.org and addresses the complexity and technical barriers that have traditionally made form building challenging for non-developers.

According to recent industry data, 73% of small business owners cite technical complexity as a major barrier to managing their WordPress websites effectively. Non-technical WordPress users have long struggled with creating custom forms, often resorting to expensive developers or settling for generic, limited templates. Existing form plugins frequently require shortcode knowledge, PHP customization, or complex configuration that intimidates beginners.

FormEase solves this problem by providing an intuitive drag-and-drop form builder directly within the WordPress admin interface. Key features include pre-built form templates, conditional logic without coding, spam protection, and seamless integration with popular email marketing services. The plugin works with any WordPress theme and requires zero technical knowledge, making professional form building accessible to everyone.

"We built FormEase because we were frustrated watching small business owners pay developers hundreds of dollars for simple contact forms," said Jane Smith, Founder and Lead Developer at Acme Digital Solutions. "Every WordPress user should be able to create the forms they need without touching a line of code or opening their wallet."

FormEase features a visual builder that allows users to add, remove, and rearrange form fields with simple drag-and-drop actions. The plugin's intelligent validation system ensures data quality, while built-in spam protection keeps submissions clean. Setup takes less than five minutes, and users can create their first professional form immediately upon installation.

During a six-month beta testing period, FormEase was used by over 500 WordPress site owners across 42 countries. Beta users reported an average time savings of 8 hours per form compared to manual coding. The plugin has already received more than 5,000 downloads since its initial release two weeks ago and maintains a 4.9-star rating on WordPress.org.

"FormEase cut our form creation time from hours to minutes," said Michael Chen, Marketing Manager at GreenTech Solutions. "What used to require hiring a developer now takes me less than 10 minutes, and the forms look more professional than what we had before."

FormEase is available now for free download on WordPress.org. A premium version with advanced features including multi-step forms, file uploads, payment integration, and priority support is available for $79 per year. For more information, visit formease.com.

Acme Digital Solutions creates WordPress plugins and tools that empower non-technical users to build and manage professional websites. The company has served the WordPress community since 2020, with products used by over 50,000 websites worldwide.

Looking ahead, Acme Digital Solutions plans to introduce additional features including CRM integrations, advanced analytics, and AI-powered form optimization. The company is committed to keeping the core plugin free while expanding capabilities based on community feedback.
