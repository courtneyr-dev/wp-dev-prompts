# Workflows

Step-by-step guides for complex WordPress development tasks.

## Available Workflows

| Workflow | What It Does |
|----------|--------------|
| [new-plugin/](new-plugin/) | Create a plugin from scratch (planning → launch) |
| [add-testing/](add-testing/) | Add testing to existing code (PHPUnit, ESLint, CI) |
| [site-review/](site-review/) | Comprehensive site audit with specialist agents |
| [block-creation/](block-creation/) | Build blocks (static → dynamic → interactive) |
| [plugin-maintenance/](plugin-maintenance/) | Routine maintenance with wp-plugins-cli |
| [tiered-agents/](tiered-agents/) | Route tasks to the right AI tool (T1/T2/T3) |

## Workflows vs Prompts

| Aspect | Workflows | Prompts |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| Structure | Multi-file, phased | Single file |
| Best for | Complex projects | Focused tasks |
| Completion | Incremental | One session |

Use **workflows** for new projects, major features, or learning a process.

Use **prompts** for specific tasks or when you know what you need.

## Using Workflows
