## Using Personas

### Feature Decisions
Ask: "Would [Persona] use this? Would they pay for it?"

### UI/UX Decisions
Ask: "Can [Persona] figure this out without documentation?"

### Pricing Decisions
Ask: "What's this worth to [Persona]? What would they compare it to?"

### Marketing Decisions
Ask: "Where does [Persona] hang out? What language do they use?"

### Support Decisions
Ask: "What questions would [Persona] ask? What would frustrate them?"

## Validation Methods

### Quantitative
- WordPress.org plugin reviews (yours and competitors)
- Support forum analysis
- Survey existing users
- Analytics on documentation pages

### Qualitative
- User interviews (5-10 per persona)
- Support ticket analysis
- Sales call recordings
- Community observation

### Signals Your Persona Is Wrong
- Features built for persona aren't used
- Marketing resonates with different audience
- Support questions don't match persona's knowledge level
- Pricing feedback contradicts budget assumptions
</knowledge>

<best_practices>
- Start with 2-3 personas maximum
- Base on real user research, not assumptions
- Update personas quarterly based on new data
- Share personas across product, marketing, and support
- Create "anti-personas" — who you're NOT building for
</best_practices>
