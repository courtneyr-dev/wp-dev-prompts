# X Writing Style Guide

> **Source**: [richtabor/agent-skills](https://github.com/richtabor/agent-skills/tree/main/skills/x-writing/references)

## Core Principle

Get to the point in the first line. No warm-up.

## Voice

### Be Confident

| Instead of | Write |
|------------|-------|
| "I think I maybe learned something" | "Here's what I learned" |
| "This might be helpful" | "This changed how I work" |
| "I'm not sure but..." | [Just state it] |

### Be Specific

| Instead of | Write |
|------------|-------|
| "Way faster than before" | "30 minutes to ship with Claude Code" |
| "A really useful tool" | "Raycast saves me 2 hours/week on window management" |
| "Recently started building" | "Day 3 of building a plugin for X" |

### Be Authentic

Focus on actual work, not feelings about work:
- What you built
- What you learned
- What surprised you
- What you'd do differently

## Structure

### Hook First

Your opening line IS the tweet. If someone only reads line 1, do they get value?

Good hooks:
- State the insight directly
- Lead with the surprising part
- Start with what you shipped/did

Bad hooks:
- "So I've been thinking..."
- "Hot take incoming..."
- "Can we talk about..."

### One Sentence Per Line

Creates natural rhythm and readability.

```
Shipped the new dashboard today.

Took 3 weeks instead of the planned 1.

The blocker? Not code. Waiting on design feedback.

Lesson: Build the feedback loop before you build the feature.
```

### White Space

Dense blocks feel exhausting. Break up ideas.

### Lists for Complexity

When you have 3+ related points, use bullets or numbers:

```
What actually worked:
- Morning focus blocks (no Slack until 11)
- 2-week sprints instead of monthly
- Demo every Friday, no exceptions
```

## Sentence Guidelines

### Length

Keep to 10-15 words maximum per sentence.

### Tense

Use active, present tense:
- "Building" not "I was building"
- "This works" not "This has worked"

### Contractions

Use them. Write like you talk:
- don't, can't, won't, isn't
- I'm, we'll, there's, let's

### Emphasis

Skip italics (they break on X). Emphasize through word choice instead.

## Content Categories

### Project Updates (~30%)
What you shipped and why it matters.

### Learnings (~30%)
Specific discoveries with context.

### Reactions (~25%)
Your angle on industry news.

### Insights (~15%)
Broader observations from work.

## Language to Avoid

### Never Use
- "game-changer"
- "revolutionary"
- "unlock"
- "dive in" / "dive deep"
- "hot take"
- "unpopular opinion"

### Corporate Jargon
- leverage
- synergy
- ecosystem
- paradigm
- holistic

### Generic Motivation
- "Keep grinding"
- "Trust the process"
- "Consistency is key"

### Passive-Aggressive
- Subtweeting
- Vague complaints
- "Some people..."

## The Formula

**[Specific action] + [Why it matters] + [Your take]**

Example:
```
Rewrote our auth flow from scratch.

Old version: 8 API calls per login.
New version: 2.

Sometimes the boring refactor is the biggest win.
```
