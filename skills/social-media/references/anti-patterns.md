# AI Writing Anti-Patterns

> **Source**: [richtabor/agent-skills](https://github.com/richtabor/agent-skills/tree/main/skills/x-writing/references)

Patterns that signal AI-generated content. Avoid all of these.

## Language

### High-Certainty AI Words

Eliminate entirely:
- delve
- showcasing
- underscore
- intricate
- meticulous
- commendable
- realm
- pivotal
- noteworthy
- versatile
- robust
- seamless
- invaluable
- groundbreaking
- multifaceted
- bespoke
- unprecedented
- transformative

### Overused Abstract Nouns

- journey
- tapestry
- landscape
- beacon
- endeavor
- testament
- symphony
- kaleidoscope
- interplay
- nuance
- facet
- prowess
- treasure trove

### Overused Abstract Verbs

- embark
- illuminate
- harness
- foster
- navigate
- leverage
- unravel
- transcend
- resonate
- catalyze
- unleash
- unlock
- elevate

### Excessive Adverbs

- profoundly
- remarkably
- notably
- crucially
- innovatively
- methodically
- tirelessly

## Tone

### Hedging Language

Weakens directness. Minimize or remove:
- may
- might
- could
- possibly
- potentially
- likely
- "research suggests"
- "studies show" (without citation)

### Qualifiers/Intensifiers

Often unnecessary:
- very
- quite
- rather
- somewhat
- extremely
- particularly
- fairly
- highly
- significantly

### Fix: Use Contractions

AI tends to avoid contractions. Humans use them:
- don't, can't, won't, isn't
- we'll, I'm, there's, let's

## Flow

### Formal Transitions

These signal AI:
- furthermore
- moreover
- additionally
- firstly, secondly, thirdly
- consequently
- subsequently
- nevertheless

**Instead**: Use simple connectors or start fresh sentences.

### Generic Phrases

- "at the end of the day"
- "dive into"
- "let's unpack"
- "game-changer"
- "cutting-edge"
- "plays a vital role"
- "in this day and age"
- "it goes without saying"

### Structural Issues

- Excessive em-dashes — like — this — everywhere
- Every sentence ending with "-ing" phrase
- "Not only...but also" constructions
- Dual adjectives ("innovative and groundbreaking")

## Patterns

### Sentence Length

AI produces monotonous rhythm. Vary lengths:
- Some sentences should be short.
- Others can extend a bit further to develop a point with more detail and context.
- Then short again.

Target 10+ word standard deviation across paragraphs.

### Paragraph Length

Same principle. Mix:
- Single-sentence paragraphs for emphasis
- 2-3 sentence standard paragraphs
- Occasional longer paragraphs when depth is needed

## Document Structure

### Clichéd Openings

Never start with:
- "In today's fast-paced world..."
- "Have you ever wondered..."
- "Let's dive into..."
- "In the realm of..."

### Clichéd Closings

- "In conclusion..."
- "To summarize..."
- "The possibilities are endless"
- "Only time will tell"

### Conclusion Length

Keep conclusions under 15-20% of total content. AI tends to over-summarize.

## Quick Checklist

- [ ] Contractions are used naturally
- [ ] No formal transitions (furthermore, moreover)
- [ ] Sentence lengths vary
- [ ] Paragraph lengths vary
- [ ] No clichéd opening or closing
- [ ] Specific details, not generic claims
- [ ] Active voice dominates
