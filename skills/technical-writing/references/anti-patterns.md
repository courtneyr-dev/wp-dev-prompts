# Anti-Patterns: Words and Phrases to Avoid

> **Source**: [richtabor/skills](https://github.com/richtabor/skills/tree/main/technical-writing)

This guide identifies vocabulary, tone, and structural patterns that distinguish AI-generated writing from natural human prose. When guidance here conflicts with the style guide, **this document takes priority**.

---

## Core Principle

> Write like you're explaining to a smart friend, not presenting to a committee.

Be **direct**, **specific**, **natural**, **original**, and **varied**.

## Language

### High-Certainty AI Indicators (Never Use)

These words immediately signal AI-generated content:

- delve
- tapestry
- myriad
- furthermore / moreover
- landscape (when abstract)
- paradigm
- synergy
- leverage (as verb)
- utilize (use "use")
- facilitate
- endeavor
- encompasses
- subsequently
- embark
- pivotal

### Overused Abstract Nouns

Replace with specifics:

| Avoid | Try Instead |
|-------|-------------|
| journey | the work, building this, the process |
| ecosystem | tools, community, stack |
| landscape | space, field, area |
| tapestry | mix, combination |
| realm | area, space |

### Abstract Verbs to Avoid

| Avoid | Try Instead |
|-------|-------------|
| harness | use, apply |
| catalyze | start, trigger |
| streamline | simplify, speed up |
| empower | let, enable, help |
| revolutionize | change, improve |
| transform | change, update |

## Tone

### Hedging Language

Cut excessive qualification:

- "It may be worth noting that..." → Just state the thing
- "One could argue..." → Make your argument
- "Perhaps it's possible..." → Say what you think

### Qualifiers to Remove

Usually unnecessary:

- very
- quite
- rather
- somewhat
- fairly
- relatively
- essentially
- basically
- actually

### Use Contractions

Write naturally:

- "It is" → "It's"
- "You are" → "You're"
- "Does not" → "Doesn't"

---

## Flow

### Formal Transitions to Avoid

| Avoid | Try Instead |
|-------|-------------|
| Furthermore | Also, And |
| Moreover | Plus |
| Additionally | And |
| In addition | Also |
| Consequently | So |
| Therefore | So |
| Nevertheless | But, Still |
| Notwithstanding | Despite |

### Generic Phrases

Replace with specifics:

- "game-changer" → describe the actual impact
- "cutting-edge" → describe what makes it new
- "best practices" → name the specific practices
- "robust solution" → describe what makes it solid
- "seamless integration" → describe how it connects

### Structural Clichés

Avoid:

- Excessive em-dashes—especially multiple per paragraph—they break reading flow
- "-ing phrase endings" (sentences ending with "allowing for better performance")
- Three-part lists in every paragraph

---

## Patterns

### Sentence Length Variation

Target a standard deviation of 10+ words in sentence length. Mix:

- Short punchy statements.
- Longer sentences that develop ideas with more detail and nuance, giving readers time to absorb complexity.
- Medium-length sentences for flow.

### Paragraph Length

Vary paragraph length:

- Single-sentence paragraphs for emphasis
- 2-3 sentence paragraphs for most content
- 4+ sentence paragraphs sparingly, for complex explanations

---

## Document Structure

### Opening Clichés (Never Start With)

- "In today's fast-paced world..."
- "Have you ever wondered..."
- "Let's dive into..."
- "In this article, we will explore..."
- "It goes without saying..."
- "[Topic] is crucial for..."

### Closing Patterns to Avoid

- "In conclusion..."
- "To summarize..."
- "As we've seen..."
- "Moving forward..."
- Conclusions longer than 15-20% of total post length

### What to Do Instead

**Openings**: Start with a specific observation, question, or the actual point.

**Closings**: End with a concrete takeaway, next step, or forward-looking thought—without announcing that you're concluding.
